    <h4>Discord Dice Rolling Bot</h4>
    <img src="6M6-Example.png" alt="6M6 Example">

    <p>Built using Python, this bot takes various commands from a user to simulate rolling multiple dice. The bot
       then displays a newly-rendered composite image from a library of custom dice images to display the results.
       The bot can save the roll values and allow the user to re-roll a specific die and render a new result image.
       In addition to displaying an image of the results, the bot also adds together the die values and displays 
       a numeric total.  This is designed for the new Marvel Multiverse RPG game and will be available for purchase
       on discord soon! </p>

    <h4>Transposition Calculator Website</h4>
    <a href="https://douglasamos.github.io/Online-Transposition-Calculator/" class="button-link" target="_blank">View Site Here!</a>
    <p>Built and hosted a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects inputs from a drop-down
       menu and the website calculates the correct transposition and displays the result in the browser. This project is
       a second iteration from a Java based project that handles the same functionality in a CLI interface.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Message Board App</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/DouglasAmos/Message-Board-App" class="button-link" target="_blank">View App Here!</a>
    <p>Created a full-stack website using an SQL database, Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, and vue.js that allows users to
       view forums, posts, and comments as an anonymous user and when logged in, can create forums and make
       posts and comments. This website was created with 4 other developers using an Agile production environment
       using a Trello board and included daily meetings, database design, paired coding, UI testing, and QA.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Payment Transfer App</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/DouglasAmos/Payment-Transfer-App" class="button-link" target="_blank">View App Here!</a>
    <p>Built a secure server that transfers money between authenticated users through a multi-step verification process.
       The user's information is stored in a PostgreSQL databased and accessed by the user using a Java controller and 
       a Spring framework. The output and endpoint APIs were then tested and validated using Postman.</p>
